# tccbin_win

This is based on prebuild [tcc compiler](https://repo.or.cz/tinycc.git), cut at commit [9eef339](https://repo.or.cz/tinycc.git/commit/9eef33993ade2d3b964d19b1081978ceae5d359d) (20200605) from mob branch. 

Please note that it is intended to be a *minimalism* version just enough to support V on *Windows*. One of the beauties of tcc is its portability. 

However, you may find this [official full version of tcc](http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/tinycc/winapi-full-for-0.9.27.zip) helpful as it includes many extra header files.
